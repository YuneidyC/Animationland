# Animationland

Minigame where you need to click on small rabbits that pop out at different speeds. The purpose was learning about CSS3 animations.

This project was developed during the course [**CSS Animation**](https://platzi.com/cursos/animaciones-css/).

# Improvements

I have added the following:

- Animation to the rabbits' ears.
- Shadow to the clouds and bush.
